Curses Library Functions ecurs_touch



NAME
     ecurs_touch - curses refresh control routines

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int touchwin(WINDOW *win);

     int touchline(WINDOW *win, int start, int count);

     int untouchwin(WINDOW *win);

     int wtouchln(WINDOW *win, int y, int n, int changed);

     int wlntouch(WINDOW *win, int y, int n, int xs, int xe);

     int is_linetouched(WINDOW *win, int line);

     int is_wintouched(WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
     The touchwin() and touchline() routines throw away all
     optimization information about which parts of the window
     have been touched, by pretending that the entire window has
     been drawn on. This is sometimes necessary when using
     overlapping windows, since a change to one window affects
     the other window, but the records of which lines have been
     changed in the other window do not reflect the change. The
     routine touchline() only pretends that count lines have been
     changed, beginning with line start.

     The untouchwin() routine marks all lines in the window as
     unchanged since the last call to wrefresh().

     The wtouchln() routine makes n lines in the window, starting
     at line y, look as if they have (changed=1) or have not
     (changed=0) been changed since the last call to wrefresh().

     The wlntouch() routine sets n lines, starting at line y, to
     have at least the range of xs to xe as marked as touched.

     The is_linetouched() and is_wintouched() routines return
     TRUE if the specified line/window was modified since the
     last call to wrefresh(); otherwise they return FALSE. In
     addition, is_linetouched() returns ERR if line is not valid
     for the given window.

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion,
     unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
