DESCRIPTION
     The following routines give low-level access to various
     curses functionality. Theses routines typically are used
     inside library routines.

     The def_prog_mode() and def_shell_mode() routines save the
     current terminal modes as the "program" (in curses) or
     "shell" (not in curses) state for use by the
     reset_prog_mode() and reset_shell_mode() routines. This is
     done automatically by initscr().

     The reset_prog_mode() and reset_shell_mode() routines
     restore the terminal to "program" (in curses) or "shell"
     (out of curses) state. These are done automatically by
     endwin() and, after an endwin(), by doupdate(), so they
     normally are not called.

     The resetty() and savetty() routines save and restore the
     state of the terminal modes. savetty() saves the current
     state in a buffer and resetty() restores the state to what
     it was at the last call to savetty().

     With the getsyx() routine, the current coordinates of the
     virtual screen cursor are returned in y and x. If leaveok()
     is currently TRUE, then -1,-1 is returned. If lines have
     been removed from the top of the screen, using ripoffline(),
     y and x include these lines; therefore, y and x should be
     used only as arguments for setsyx().

     With the setsyx() routine, the virtual screen cursor is set
     to y, x. If y and x are both -1, then leaveok() is set. The
     two routines getsyx() and setsyx() are designed to be used
     by a library routine, which manipulates curses windows but
     does not want to change the current position of the
     program's cursor. The library routine would call getsyx() at
     the beginning, do its manipulation of its own windows, do a
     wnoutrefresh() on its windows, call setsyx(), and then call
     doupdate().

     The ripoffline() routine provides access to the same
     facility that slk_init() (see ecurs_slk) uses to reduce
     the size of the screen. ripoffline() must be called before
     initscr() or newterm() is called. If line is positive, a
     line is removed from the top of stdscr(); if line is
     negative, a line is removed from the bottom. When this is
     done inside initscr(), the routine init() (supplied by the
     user) is called with two arguments: a window pointer to the
     one-line window that has been allocated and an integer with
     the number of columns in the window. Inside this
     initialization routine, the integer variables LINES and COLS
     (defined in <curses.h>) are not guaranteed to be accurate
     and wrefresh() or doupdate() must not be called. It is
     allowable to call wnoutrefresh() during the initialization
     routine. The ripoffmline() does the same thing, but allows
     the line argument to specify the number of lines in the
     window that is created.

     ripoffline() can be called up to five times before calling
     initscr() or newterm().

     With the curs_set() routine, the cursor state is set to
     invisible, normal, or very visible for visibility values:

         VISIBILITY_OFF      0    cursor invisible
         VISIBILITY_ON       1    cursor visible (normal)
         VISIBILITY_VERY_ON  2    cursor very visible

     If the terminal supports the visibility requested, the
     previous cursor state is returned; otherwise, ERR is
     returned.

     The napms() routine is used to sleep for ms milliseconds.

RETURN VALUES
     Except for curs_set(), these routines always return OK.
     curs_set() returns the previous cursor state, or ERR if the
     requested visibility is not supported.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.

     Note that getsyx() is a macro, so an ampersand (&) is not
     necessary before the variables y and x.
