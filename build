# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Script to setup the environment for a build.
#
#	This script MUST be SOURCED (not run) prior to doing a build.
#
#	usage:	. build [-r|-d|-p] [-q] <platform>
#
#	where:
#			-r			specify "release" mode
#			-d			specify "debug"   mode
#			-p			specify "profile" mode
#			-q			quiet (no output) (except for errors)
#			platform	platform to build for
#
#	If no options and platform are specified, they will be loaded from
#	"build.opt" if present.  Otherwise, the script "guess" will be run
#	to try to determine the platform.  See "bin/guess.sh" for details.
#
#	This script will save the current options in "build.opt" if they changed.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (set by "build")
#
#	This script sets the following environment variables:
#
#		PLATFORM		Set to <platform> from the cmd line.
#
#		OS_TYPE			O/S type ("UNIX" or "WINDOWS").
#
#		SRC_DIR			Name of top-level of source tree.	(`pwd`)
#						Note that in Windows, this will always contain
#						the drive letter as well as the directory.
#
#		BIN_DIR			Name of bin directory.				($SRC_DIR/bin)
#		LIB_DIR			Directory where libraries are put.	($SRC_DIR/lib)
#
#		LIB_TGT			Library directory.  This is the same as $LIB_DIR,
#						but with any drive letter removed, so it can be
#						used as a target in makefiles.
#
#						This is only needed in Windows, since in Windows a
#						target cannot have a drive letter unless it is quoted,
#						which breaks Unix makes, and library references
#						in link cmds must have a drive letter or it is
#						interpreted as an option (since we use "/"
#						instead of "\").
#
#						Interestingly, GNU make deals just fine with drive
#						letters in a target.
#
#		DST_DIR			Deliver directory.
#						This directory is for delivered "program" files.
#						This variable is not changed if already set.
#						Default is "$SRC_DIR/dist".
#
#		UTL_DIR			Utilities directory.
#						This directory is for delivered "utility" programs.
#						This variable is not changed if already set.
#						Default is "$SRC_DIR/util".
#
#		WIN_DIR			Windows directory.
#						This directory is for delivered "ecurses" files.
#						This variable is not changed if already set.
#						Default is "$SRC_DIR/ecur".
#
#		INS_DIR			Directory to install into.
#						This variable is not changed if already set.
#						Default is:
#							Unix	"/usr/local/$PROGRAM"
#							Windows	"$SystemDrive/Program Files/$PACKAGE"
#
#		SKU_DIR			SKU deliver directory.
#						This variable is not changed if already set.
#						Default is "$HOME/sku".
#
#		DELIVER			Cmd to deliver files			("deliver.sh")
#		INSTALL			Cmd to install files			("$DELIVER -i")
#		HDRCOMP			Cmd to compare header files		("hdrcomp.sh")
#		LISTSRC			Cmd to list source files		("listsrc.sh")
#		MAKELIB			Cmd to create libraries			("makelib.sh")
#		MAKESKU			Cmd to create SKU packages		("makesku.sh")
#		TEXTSUB			Cmd to do text substitutions	("textsub.sh")
#		XRFLIST			Cmd to create xref lists		("xrflist.sh")
#
#		OBJ_EXT			Object  file extension ("o" or "obj").
#		LIB_EXT			Library file extension ("a" or "lib").
#		EXE_EXT			Executable   extension ("" or ".exe").
#
#		OS_CLEAN		Platform-specific created files to be cleaned
#						which are not specifically named in makefiles.
#
#		DEV_NULL		Name of bit-bucket ("/dev/null" or "NUL:").
#
#		CDEFS			Platform-specific compile flags.
#						Note that the "env" file may set this and "build"
#						adds any necessary debug/optimize flags.
#
#		LDDEFS			Platform-specific link flags.
#						Note that the "env" file may set this and "build"
#						adds any necessary debug/optimize flags.
#
#		MAKEFLAGS		Make flags to enforce environment-var overrides.
#						This variable is not changed if already set.
#
#		PATH			Set to ".:$BIN_DIR:$PATH".
#
#		MANPATH			Set to "$SRC_DIR/libecurses:$MANPATH".
#						This provides man pages for the extended-curses
#						library as a convienence to the programmer.
#
#	Additional variables may be set by "env/$PLATFORM.env" as described below.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (set by $PLATFORM.env file)
#
#	This script "sources" the file "env/$PLATFORM.env" which sets all the
#	other environment variables needed for building and packaging on
#	a particular platform.
#
#		ARCH		Machine architecture type.  This value is
#					used in producing O/S-specific install packages
#					(such as pkgadd & rpm).
#
#					Currently used names are:
#
#						name		platform
#						------		-----------------
#						alpha		Digital alpha
#						i386		Intel x86
#						mips		SGI MIPS
#						m88k		Motorola 88k
#						parisc		HP PA/risc
#						rs6000		IBM RS6000/PowerPC
#						ppc			PowerPC
#						sparc		Sun sparc
#
#					Currently, this variable is not used if no O/S-specific
#					install package is created.  If it is not specified,
#					it will be set to the output of "uname -p".
#
#					This entry is referenced in package/*/makefile.
#
#		SKU			The name the SKU is packaged with.
#					All SKUs are named <name>-$SKU.<ext>
#					The standard we use is "<architecture-name>-<OS-name>",
#					for example, "x86-linux" for Linux on Intel boxes.
#
#					If this value is not specified, it will be set to
#					"$ARCH-$PLATFORM".
#
#					This entry is referenced in package/makefile,
#					package/*/makefile, & libecurses/makefile.
#
#		FS_TYPE		File-system type.
#
#					Valid entries (currently) are:
#
#						fs-type		O/S
#						-------		------------------------
#						aix			AIX
#						bsd			FreeBSD, OpenBSD, SunOS, & OS/X
#						cygwin		Windows (using cygwin-gcc)
#						dg			DG/ux
#						hp			HP/ux
#						linux		Linux
#						netbsd		NetBSD
#						osf			OSF
#						posix		POSIX (currently a no-op)
#						sgi			IRIX
#						svr3		generic SVR3
#						svr4		generic SVR4
#						win			Windows
#
#					A new file-system type may be added by adding a new
#					source file "libos/osmnt-$FS_TYPE.c".
#
#					If you have no idea how to deal with the mount table
#					and/or how to get free-space info for a file-system,
#					then set your "FS_TYPE" to "posix".
#					This will result in not being able to read the list
#					of "mounted" file-systems or being able to query the
#					amount of free-space in a file-system, but at least
#					you will be able to build & run the program.
#
#					If this value is not specified, it will be set to "posix".
#
#					This entry is referenced in libos/makefile to specify
#					the appropriate osmnt-*.c file to compile.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (optional)

#					on the make cmd line.
#
#		OPTS		Additional flags to be passed to both the C compiler
#					and the linker.  It is intended to be used on the
#					make cmd line.

#
#		LINT		The name of the lint program for "linting" source files.
#					This is used to do a very anal check of the source code.
#					It is not needed for normal builds.
#					Default is "lint".
#
#		MAKEFLAGS	Option flags to set for make.  The default is
#					"" for non-GNU makes and "--no-print-directory"

#					Used in "package/makefile".
#					Currently, the only special packages supported are:
#
#						rpm		for Linux
#						pkgadd	for SVR4
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	PROGRAM VARIABLES (Set by "pgminfo")
#
#	The "build" script sources the file "pgminfo", which contains all
#	program information strings.  See "pgminfo" for details.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	BUILD VARIABLES (Set by "bldinfo")
#
#	The "build" script sources the file "pgminfo", which contains all
#	build information strings.  See "bldinfo" for details.
#
#	In particular, there are two entries in "bldinfo" which should be
#	set by the person doing the build, so we can identify builds.
#	These entries are:
#
#		BUILDER_NAM				Name of the person doing the build
#		BUILDER_EMA				Email address of that person
#
#	If not set, they will default to the following:
#
#		BUILDER_NAM				"gcos" (real-name) field from passwd
#								entry for $LOGNAME
#
#		BUILDER_EMA				$LOGNAME@`domainname`
#
#	This information is displayed via the "-ZV" cmd-line option.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	SUMMARY NOTES
#
#	1.	Be sure that you "source" this script (". build <platform>")
#		rather than just running it, since it must set variables in
#		the current shell.  (You should get a warning message if this
#		script is "run" instead of "sourced".)
#
#	2.	This script will "source" the script "env/$PLATFORM.env"
#		to setup platform-specific env variables.
#
#		It also "sources" the script "pgminfo", which contains all
#		program-specific variables, & the script "bldinfo", which
#		contains all build-specific variables.
#
#	3.	This script adds the directories "." and "$BIN_DIR" to the
#		front of the PATH.
#
#	4.	All "delivered" files go into the directory $DST_DIR, which by
#		default is "$SRC_DIR/dist".  If this variable is set prior to
#		sourcing this script, that value will be used instead.
#
#		Utility programs are delivered to $UTL_DIR, which by default
#		is "$SRC_DIR/util".
#
#		The libecurses package is delivered to $WIN_DIR, which by default
#		is "$SRC_DIR/ecur".
#
#	5.	All "SKU packages" are placed in the directory $SKU_DIR, which
#		by default is "$HOME/sku".  This allows for multiple build directories
#		to share a common SKU directory.  If this variable is set prior to
#		sourcing this script, that value will be used instead.

# Fix PATH env variable (Windows only)
#
# Under Windows, the $PATH is initially set with all backslashes, but MKS
# is kind enough to double them for us so they work properly upon entry.
# However, we do a fair amount of editing on this $PATH via echo and
# sed, and this breaks things badly.
#
# We see this if the path upon entry is \\bin, because the double \\ is
# converted to a single one by echo, and the next one converts \b to a
# backspace -- this is not at all helpful.
#
# So, if there is any kind of backslash in the path we convert any number
# of them to a single forward slash. Note that we do not do an echo on
# the initial path -- we instead use "set" which won't do any backslash
# expansion of any kind. We just pick out the one line that starts with
# "PATH="
#
# NOTE: This will break Windows network paths such as \\MACHINE\SHARE\dir.
# We probably don't care about this.
